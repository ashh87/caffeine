Roadmap:

Update caffeine to:
* run correctly first time (https://bugs.launchpad.net/caffeine/+bug/691759 ??)
* change flash behaviour - flash video no longer detected but we can detect full screen flash
* change flash so caffeine reacts to any shell command, add full screen flash as a default option
* add default and extra Actions to every trigger so, for example, full screen flash only stops locking for a few hours - may be good if you want to fall asleep to streaming video!
* fix change http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~caffeine-developers/caffeine/main/revision/405 https://bugs.launchpad.net/caffeine/+bug/878690 because this change breaks other cases.
